To solve the problem, the goal is to determine the fewest operations required to generate exactly n characters of H in a text file, starting from one character H. The two operations available are:

Copy All: This operation copies the current contents of the file.
Paste: This operation pastes the contents that were copied by the last "Copy All" operation.
